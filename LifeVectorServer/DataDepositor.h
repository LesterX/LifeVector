/* 
 * This Class is a method used to save the raw, unprocessed GPS coordinate
 * data received from the mobile device to the database. The raw data is
 * the parsed json stored in C++ objects already. The database pointer
 * received is already initialized, with connection SQL server already
 * established. This is saved according to the user, so deviceID is used
 * to identify the user this data being stored is assoiated with.
